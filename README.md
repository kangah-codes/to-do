# to-do
A very simple TODO app written in Python with the guizero library

# requirements
guizero == 0.6.2
python 3.6+
tkinter (linux users)

# notes
Linux users use sudo apt-get install python3-tk to install tkinter

This version of the program has been tested only in Ubuntu
After testing on a Windows platform, it has proven to be buggy

Still working to clean it up for Windows
